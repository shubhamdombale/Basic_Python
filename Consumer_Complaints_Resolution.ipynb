I have been trying to work with the Credit Reporting Agency but they are refusing to honor my valid identity theft case thus these incorrect/fraudulent items are still on my credit report and they must be removed immediately but they are do not belong to me. I have provided all of the proof to show that I was a victim of Identity Theft and that to the best of my knowledge these fraudulent accounts do not belong to me. Please take immediate action on my behalf so I can have these items removed, deleted and permanently blocked from my credit report, so that I can get back on track to a normal life. \\n\\nRegards \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 19\n",

I call back and they say it takes two days but now it is numerous harassing calls and they number they leave to call back is this same number but the voicemail is full so they hide behind the fact that you can not leave a voicemail. The first day it happens I did leave a voicemail but now can not. Please prosecute pas this is not me and they continue to harass me. XXXX XXXX is their reference. \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n",

       "Hello, I opened a Citi Gold Checking account XX/XX/2015 per the terms of the XXXX XXXX XXXX Advantage miles promotion. Promotion code : XXXX I have yet to received the miles posted to my account and it is well past the deadline. Citi bank is being unresponsive. \\n\\n\\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, I had completed the requirements of the promotion. In XX/XX/XXXX, after not receiving my miles, I reached out to Citibank via phone to see why I had n't received my points. They confirmed that I had met all of the requirements of the promotion and should receive my miles within 30 days. \\n\\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, I had not received my points so I called again and they said that I needed to complete a XXXX in order to receive the miles. They mailed me one and I immediately filled it out and returned. \\n\\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, I still had not received my points so I call again and requested to speak with a supervisor. The supervisor confirmed that I had completed the requirements of the promotion but that they needed my XXXX XXXX Advantage #. I provided the number and they stated that I would receive the miles within 30 days. I still have not received my miles. \\n\\nI feel that I have been scammed by Citi because I completed all of the necessary requirement and had that confirmed by multiple people at Citi, yet they have not followed through on their end of the deal. I have spent several hours on the phone and on secure messager over this issue. I am simply requesting that Citi deposit the promised XXXX XXXX XXXX miles into my account. \\n\\nThank you,     1\n",
